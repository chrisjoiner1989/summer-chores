# Summer Chores

This project demonstrates two different approaches to handling asynchronous JavaScript tasks â€” using **callbacks** and **promises**.

## Overview

A fictional character completes a series of summer chores in a strict order. As they get more tired, there's a chance they may fall asleep and not complete the tasks.

Chores include:

1. Mow the yard
2. Weed eat around the house and fence
3. Trim the hedges
4. Collect wood for fires
5. Water the garden

Each chore takes a set amount of time (simulated with `setTimeout`), and the person loses energy after each task.
