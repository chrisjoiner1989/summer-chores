# Summer Chores

This project simulates a callback-based routine for summer chores using Node.js. It's part of an exercise series inspired by Bro Code and FreeCodeCamp to practice JavaScript fundamentals such as:

- Callback functions
- setTimeout for asynchronous flow
- Chore routines and state logic
